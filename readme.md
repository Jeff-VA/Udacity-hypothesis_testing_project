### Project Title
A_B hypothesis testing with Python

### Description
This project demonstrates the use of the following statistical methods to analyze data in python:

* bootstrapping
* z-test functions
* logistic regression models

Although all three statistical methods are performed in the primary A/B Analysis notebook, an overview of the bootstrapping method is 
briefly described in the following slideshow:
